            <p>
                MuseBid was born from a simple idea — to make fine art accessible to everyone, not just galleries and elite collectors.
                We believe every artist deserves a global stage, and every collector deserves a chance to discover something extraordinary.
            </p>

                Founded in 2025, MuseBid brings together artists, collectors, and enthusiasts through a seamless online auction experience.
                Whether you’re showcasing your first painting or bidding on a masterpiece, our platform celebrates the story behind every work of art.
